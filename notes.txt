Bug Fixes:
- number of pages glitch: when a team is selected and user on high page(eg. 10),
    the page doesnt reset back to 1
- player icons don't display both teams in a double GW
- transferred players can't be subbed

UI Fixes:
- Subs bench
- 'selected' player in squad/table for transfers
- Grey out players that you cannot swap/transfer
- More detail in the player table:
    - kit icon (sm), name-bold, team, position 
    - general UI improvements

To Do:
- Player search functionality
- gameweek switching:
    - need a gameweek state which tracks the current GW based on datetime (now)
    - gameweek state sets the fixtures displayed in the player icons
