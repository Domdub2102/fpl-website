Bug Fixes:
- number of pages glitch: when a team is selected and user on high page(eg. 10),
    the page doesnt reset back to 1
- isSelected -> isSelected doesnt get removed if sub/transfer players fails


UI Fixes:
- Subs bench
- 'selected' player in table for transfers
- Grey out players that you cannot swap/transfer
- More detail in the player table:
    - kit icon (sm), name-bold, team, position 
    - general UI improvements

To Do:
- Player search functionality
- Transfers:
    - Remove transfers for now?
    - Other option is add 'Create (set) Initial Squad' button, which stores users team as the base, then counts transfers from there
    - Need to use caching (local storage) to set the value of the squad
- Change Budget to Squad Value:
    - use now_cost property to calculate total value
