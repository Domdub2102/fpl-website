Bug Fixes:
- number of pages glitch: when a team is selected and user on high page(eg. 10),
    the page doesnt reset back to 1
- isSelected -> isSelected doesnt get removed if sub/transfer players fails


UI Fixes:
- Subs bench
- 'selected' player in table for transfers
- Grey out players that you cannot swap/transfer
- removing a player auto filters the players table to their position


To Do:
- Transfers:
    - Remove transfers for now?
    - Other option is add 'Create (set) Initial Squad' button, which stores users team as the base, then counts transfers from there
    - Need to use caching (local storage) to set the value of the squad
- Change Budget to Squad Value:
    - use now_cost property to calculate total value
- add dark theme to squad and fixtures page?
- Team Selector checklist in FDR page
- Ability to click on GW headers ans sort for that individual week
- useMemo() to prevent unnecessary reruns of function initialisations


Major Changes:
- FORM:
    - Allow the user to look at 'form' tables of both teams and players 
    - Need to have recent xG data of teams:
    - Either scrape off understat, or calculate using players fixtures:
    - Need to iterate fixtures and add to TeamXG array
